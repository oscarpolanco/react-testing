## Section 1: Introduction

Sometimes we test the UI and got a test that has a behavior but breaks when we change the structure beside the user have still had the same experience than before so when we are testing; we need to identify the most important part that we wanna verify about those components; we want to verify the user experience and how I want to verify this experience instead of verifying the DOM structure for example.

### How to run the first example

- Install all dependicies on the `root` and `configuration/calculator.solution`
- On the root of the project type the following command: `npm run test:react`
- type `p`
- type `section_1_introduction` and you will be on the `jest` watch mode
